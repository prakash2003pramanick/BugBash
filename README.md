Bug Bash Event Documentation
Event Name: Bug Bash
Event Date: [Insert Date]
Event Duration: 1 hour - (Tentative)
Overview: The Bug Bash event challenges participants to fix bugs in DSA-related programs. Participants can choose between Python and Java for their coding language. The event consists of three levels of questions: easy, medium, and hard. The difficulty levels and their respective marks are designed to reward participants for tackling more challenging problems.
Question Levels and Marks: 
These are example change the marking scheme whatever suits you best
[Keep the ratio such that someone who solves higher difficulty level questions has advantage over others]
Easy: 5 marks
Medium: 8 marks
Hard: 10 marks
Event Format:
Participants will receive an Excel sheet containing brief descriptions of the questions.
Against each question number, there will be a checkbox.
Once a participant fixes a bug, they will check the corresponding box to indicate it for evaluation.
Rules and Scoring:
Negative Marking: To prevent participants from marking questions as completed without actually fixing the bugs, negative marking will be implemented. Incorrectly marked questions will result in a deduction of points.
Scoring: Full marks are awarded for correctly fixed bugs, and negative marks are given for incorrectly marked questions.
Tie-Breaker: 
In case of a tie, the participant who finished and left the lab earlier will be declared the winner. Hence, note the time when a participant submits the final version.
If the tie persists, the participant who solved more number of, `higher difficult level` questions will be given an advantage. 


Evaluation:
After the event, evaluators will verify the questions marked as completed.
Correctly fixed bugs will receive the assigned marks.
Incorrectly marked questions will incur negative marks.
Winner Selection:
The winner will be the participant with the highest total score.
In case of a tie, the following criteria will be used:
Number of higher difficulty level questions solved.
Time of completion and leaving the lab.
Instructions for Participants:
Choose Your Language: Select either Python or Java for the event.
Fix the Bugs: Work on fixing the bugs in the given programs.
Mark Completion: Once you fix a bug, check the corresponding box in the Excel sheet.
Submit on Time: You have 1 hour to complete the event. You can leave early if you finish before the allotted time.
Preparation Tips:
Brush up on your DSA concepts and practice debugging in Python or Java.
Familiarize yourself with common bug patterns and errors in coding.

Instructions for Event Hosts
Pre-Event Preparation:
Create a GitHub Repository:
Set up a repository for question preparation where anyone can contribute.
Share the repository link with contributors and provide guidelines for submitting questions.
Install Necessary Software:
VS Code: Ensure VS Code is installed on all lab computers.
Python 3: Make sure Python 3 is installed on all lab computers.
Ensure Program Execution:
Verify that the programs can be executed without issues.
Create sample test runs to check for any potential execution problems.
Develop Test Programs:
Create comprehensive test programs to check participants' solutions against various scenarios.
Use these tests to ensure the robustness of the solutions.
During the Event:
Assist with Technical Issues:
Be available to help participants with running their programs.
Address any configuration issues from the host side but do not assist with fixing bugs or errors in their code.
Evaluate Submissions:
Verify the questions marked as completed by participants.
Award marks for correctly fixed bugs and apply negative marking for incorrect submissions.
Utilizing GPT for Question Preparation:
Generate Buggy Questions:
Use GPT to create a variety of buggy questions for the event.
Convert these questions into Python and Java formats.
Create Test Cases:
Develop test cases for each question to ensure thorough evaluation.
Make sure the test cases cover a wide range of scenarios.
Good Luck with Hosting the Event!
